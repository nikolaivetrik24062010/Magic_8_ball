# Magic 8 Ball – Android Security Research Project

Simple Android application created as a **learning and security research exercise**.  
The purpose of this project is **not the functionality itself**, but understanding how simple apps are built, analyzed, reverse-engineered, and protected.

---

## 🎯 Security Learning Goal

- Analyze application logic and behavior
- Understand how client-side logic can be:
  - Reversed
  - Modified
  - Hooked
- Practice basic mobile application analysis
- Identify what **should not be trusted on the client**
- Build intuition for:
  - Tampering risks
  - Logic exposure
  - Reverse engineering basics

---

## 📱 Functionality

- Single button interaction
- Random answer generation
- Minimal UI and logic
- No backend or network dependency

This simplicity makes the app ideal for:
- Static analysis
- Dynamic analysis
- Runtime inspection
- APK reversing practice

---

## 🔍 Security Perspective

This project helps understand:

- How easily app logic can be extracted
- Why client-side randomness is not secure
- How predictable logic can be abused
- What protections are needed in real applications:
  - Code obfuscation
  - Logic offloading
  - Runtime checks

---

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Mobile Application Security basics
- Reverse engineering practice
- Android internals learning
- Entry-level AppSec training project
- Preparation for Mobile / Application Security roles
